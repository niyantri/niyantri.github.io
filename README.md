    <h2> Pitch Perfect <h2> 
      <p> Pitch Perfect was a great movie! I loved it! Here is a quick summary: At a national a cappella competition, the Barden University's all-female a cappella group, the Barden Bellas, perform well until Aubrey Posen projectile vomits on stage during her solo. They are publicly humiliated, losing any chance of winning. Four months later, newly arrived Barden freshman Beca Mitchell has no desire to attend college, but she is forced to do so by her father, a professor at the university, with whom Beca has a strained relationship. When Beca's father discovers she has not been attending classes, he comes to her with a proposition: if she joins a club and still does not want to remain at college after one year, he will allow her to leave school, and he will pay for Beca to move to Los Angeles to pursue her music career. After some persuasion from group leader Chloe Beale, she reluctantly joins the Barden Bellas. Aubrey does not initially approve of recruiting Beca, but yields nonetheless due to a desperate need for members and Beca's talent. Beca joins alongside a group of other women who do not fit the Bellas' typical mold: Cynthia-Rose, Stacie Conrad, Lilly Onakuramara, and Fat Amy. Jesse is also revealed to have joined the Bellas' all-male rival group, the Treblemakers.At the semi-finals, Beca provides an impromptu back-up of one of her favorite songs into the "traditional" song on the Bellas' set list to reinvigorate the crowd after they seemed to have lost interest. The Bellas come in third in the competition behind the Treblemakers and the Footnotes. Even though the audience seemed to enjoy Beca's remix, Aubrey becomes furious with Beca, who in turn quits. When the Footnotes are later disqualified from the national competition because the lead singer was in high school, the Bellas are called to take part instead. The Bellas re-form after spring break, with the notable exception of Beca. During rehearsals, Chloe stands up against Aubrey's stubbornness. The group starts to fall apart, which sparks a fight. Meanwhile, Beca tries to apologize to Jesse, which he declines. Beca then apologizes to the Bellas for her actions during the semi-finals and asks to have another chance, which Aubrey eventually allows. After having a group heart-to-heart conversation, the Bellas decide to adopt Beca's more modern and original music style. Meanwhile, group leader Bumper leaves the Treblemakers after being offered a job as a back-up singer for John Mayer. With Bumper gone, Jesse persuades the Trebles to let his previously rejected roommate Benji join the group in Bumper's place.

At the a cappella national competition, the Bellas sing a piece arranged by Beca, which includes "Don't You (Forget About Me)" a song featured in The Breakfast Club, one of Jesse's favorite movies. This acts as a more effective apology from Beca, and after the performance, she and Jesse kiss. The Bellas win the national competition, and six months later, auditions for new members take place. <p>

      <h1> Despecible Me 2 <h2>
        <p> A mysterious vehicle using a huge magnet steals a powerful mutagen known as PX-41 from a secret laboratory in the Arctic Circle. The Anti-Villain League (AVL) tries to recruit former supervillain, Gru, to find out who stole the mutagen. Gru refuses to help, claiming he is a legitimate businessman now as well as the father of Margo, Edith, and Agnes. Dr. Nefario, Gru's friend and assistant, has decided to leave him for new employment. Dr. Nefario's reasoning was because he "missed being evil." Gru reluctantly partners with undercover AVL agent, Lucy Wilde, and they search Gru's local mall, the Paradise Shopping Mall, disguised as bakery employees. Mexican restaurant owner, Eduardo PÃ©rez, is suspected by Gru of being "El Macho", who is a legendary supervillain. "El Macho" supposedly died after skysurfing a shark into the center of an active volcano. Gru and Lucy break into Eduardo's restaurant at night, but find nothing to prove that Eduardo is the culprit. Meanwhile, Agnes expresses her wish to have a mother someday and believes that Gru will fall in love with Lucy. Despite Agnes' excitement, Gru tells her that his relationship with Lucy is strictly professional.

Gru and Lucy investigate wig merchant Floyd Eagle-san, but Gru is still suspicious of Eduardo, after seeing Eduardo's two-timing son, Antonio, going out with Margo, and Eduardo inviting everyone to come to his Cinco de Mayo party. After the investigation, Gru is set up on a horrible dinner date with a rude woman named Shannon, who notices Gru's wig and threatens to humiliate him. Luckily, Lucy bumps into them and rescues him from the date by shooting Shannon with a tranquilizer dart. They take Shannon home, and after they say good night, Gru realizes that Agnes was right: he has fallen in love with Lucy.

The next day, the AVL arrests Floyd Eagle-san (who claims that he was framed) because an almost-empty mutagen jar was found in his shop. The investigation is closed, and Lucy is reassigned to Australia. Before leaving, Lucy gives Gru her lipstick Taser to remind him of her. This leaves Gru heartbroken because he loves her, but he cannot find the courage to ask her out on a date. Instead he brings the girls to the Cinco de Mayo party and finds proof that the Mexican restaurateur is in fact El Macho. Gru discovers that he and his partner, (who turns out to be Dr. Nefario), have captured and mutated a large number of Gru's Minions using the PX-41, turning them into insane, savage purple-furred monsters. El Macho plans to send rockets full of mutated Minions to major cities and achieve world domination. El Macho proposes that he and Gru team up. Gru avoids answering and leaves with his children. Gru saves lucy from a shark with a tnt load that is going into a volcano and they get married and live happily ever after. <p>
